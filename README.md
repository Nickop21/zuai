This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

#### First, Install node package manager:

```bash
npm i

```

#### Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev 
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

### Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view your application in action. The page auto-updates as you edit the app/page.js file.

# üöß Challenges and Problems Faced

Throughout the development of this project, I encountered several challenges and hurdles that were both demanding and educational. Here are some of the key issues I faced:

- **File Handling Issues:** Getting the drag and drop functionality to work smoothly across different browsers and file types was trickier than expected. Handling edge cases and ensuring compatibility required a lot of testing and tweaking.

- **Real-time Data Sync:** Keeping data in sync with the UI in real-time was a complex task. It was particularly challenging to maintain performance and consistency when dealing with large datasets and frequent updates. I had to delve into optimizations to ensure a seamless user experience.

- **State Management Complexity:** Integrating Zustand for state management with local storage brought its own set of challenges. Ensuring that the state was persisted correctly and avoiding any synchronization issues required a thoughtful approach and frequent debugging.

- **Performance Optimization:** Achieving smooth performance with animations and transitions, especially on lower-end devices, was a significant focus. It involved a lot of fine-tuning and optimization to ensure that the user experience remained fluid and responsive.

- **Responsive Design Challenges:** Crafting a pixel-perfect design that looked great across various screen sizes and devices was a meticulous process. It demanded extensive testing and careful adjustments to the CSS to achieve a consistent appearance everywhere.

- **PDF Handling Difficulties:** Implementing PDF features like resizing, zooming, and handling different formats posed some technical challenges. Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and smooth functionality required a deep dive into PDF handling libraries and custom solutions.

- **Error Handling and Validation:** Robust error handling and validation for user inputs and file uploads were crucial. Managing different scenarios and edge cases to enhance the user experience involved a lot of trial and error.

Despite these challenges, each problem presented an opportunity for learning and growth. They pushed me to explore new solutions and ultimately led to a more refined and effective project. Every obstacle overcame has been a step towards making this application better and more robust.


# üß™ Test Cases

## **1. File Handling**

### **Test Case: Drag and Drop File Upload**
- **Description:** Verify that files can be dragged and dropped into the upload area.
- **Steps:**
  1. Simulate dragging a file over the upload area.
  2. Drop the file into the upload area.
  3. Verify that the file is correctly added to the upload list.
- **Expected Result:** The file should be added to the upload list, and a success message should be displayed.

### **Test Case: File Type Validation**
- **Description:** Ensure that only supported file types can be uploaded.
- **Steps:**
  1. Try to upload a file of an unsupported type.
  2. Verify that an error message is displayed.
- **Expected Result:** The system should display an error message indicating the file type is not supported.

## **2. Real-time Data Sync**

### **Test Case: Real-time Data Update**
- **Description:** Verify that the UI updates in real-time when data changes.
- **Steps:**
  1. Update a data entry in the application.
  2. Observe the UI to ensure the change is reflected immediately.
- **Expected Result:** The UI should update in real-time to reflect the data change.

## **3. State Management**

### **Test Case: Zustand State Persistence**
- **Description:** Ensure that state is correctly persisted in local storage using Zustand.
- **Steps:**
  1. Update some state in the application.
  2. Refresh the page or restart the application.
  3. Verify that the state persists across reloads.
- **Expected Result:** The state should persist and be restored correctly after a refresh or restart.
